# OEP-NNNN: Your short, descriptive title

<!--
This is the title of your OEP. Keep it short, simple, and descriptive. A good
title can help communicate what the OEP is and should be considered as part of
any review.
-->

<!--
A table of contents helps readers quickly navigate the OEP and highlights
additional information provided beyond the standard template.

Ensure the TOC is wrapped with
  <code>&lt;!-- toc --&rt;&lt;!-- /toc --&rt;</code>
tags, and generate it using `hack/update-toc.sh`.

## Summary

<!--
This section is crucial for producing high-quality, user-focused
documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap. Collect this
information before implementation begins to ensure implementers can focus
fully on development rather than documentation. OEP editors and SIG Docs
should help ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section serves
a wide audience effectively.

A good summary should be at least a paragraph in length and clearly articulate
the proposal's purpose and impact.

Both in this section and throughout the document, follow the guidelines of the
[documentation style guide]. Wrap lines to a reasonable length to facilitate
review and minimize diff churn on updates.

[documentation style guide]: https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/guide/style-guide.md
-->

## Motivation

<!--
This section explicitly outlines the motivation, goals, and non-goals of
this OEP. Clearly describe why the change is important and its benefits to users.
The motivation section may include links to [experience reports] to demonstrate
broader community interest in this OEP.

[experience reports]: https://go.dev/wiki/ExperienceReports
-->

### Goals

<!--
List the specific goals of the OEP. What is it trying to achieve? How will we
know that this has succeeded?
-->

### Non-Goals

<!--
What is out of scope for this OEP? Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion
and make progress.
-->

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### User Stories (Optional)

<!--
Detail specific use cases that will be enabled by this OEP implementation.
Provide sufficient detail to help readers understand the practical impact
and functionality without getting overly technical.
-->

#### Story 1

#### Story 2

### Notes/Constraints/Caveats (Optional)

<!--
What are the caveats to the proposal?
What are important details that weren't covered above?
Provide as much detail as necessary here.
This section is ideal for discussing core concepts and their relationships.
-->

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate them? Consider:

1. Security implications and review process
2. Impact on the broader Kubernetes ecosystem
3. Performance considerations
4. Compatibility concerns
5. Operational complexity

Include review requirements for both security and UX, specifying who will
conduct these reviews.

Consider seeking input from contributors outside the immediate SIG or subproject.
-->

## Design Details

<!--
This section should provide comprehensive information about your implementation
approach. Include:

1. API specifications (when applicable)
2. Component interactions
3. Design rationale
4. Implementation considerations

If there's any ambiguity about the implementation approach, address it here
with clear explanations and examples.
-->

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Required when targeting a release.*

Ensure comprehensive test coverage to maintain quality. Follow the
[Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines] when developing this plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

[ ] I/we understand that component owners may require updates to
existing tests before accepting changes necessary for this enhancement.

##### Prerequisite Testing Updates

<!--
Based on review feedback, outline additional tests needed to ensure
this enhancement's solid foundation prior to implementation.
-->

#### Unit Tests

<!--
All new code should strive for complete unit test coverage. If full coverage
is not feasible, provide a clear explanation of the limitations and why
they are acceptable.

For modified core packages, document current test coverage:
- <package>: <date> - <current coverage %> - <explanation if needed>
-->

- `<package>`: `<date>` - `<test coverage>`

#### Integration Tests

<!--
Specify integration tests that will verify the enhancement's functionality
within the broader system. Include:

1. Test scenarios
2. Integration points to be tested
3. Expected behaviors
4. Error conditions to validate

After implementation, document the actual test names and locations here.
-->

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
Define clear, measurable criteria for considering this feature implemented
and stable. For complex features, consider including:

1. Maturity levels (alpha, beta, stable)
2. Feature gate progression
3. Performance requirements
4. Scalability thresholds
5. Deprecation timeline

Reference relevant policies:
- [Maturity levels][maturity-levels]
- [Feature gate][feature gate] lifecycle
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

[feature gate]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/feature-gates.md
[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/
-->

## Implementation History

<!--
Document key milestones in the OEP's lifecycle, including:

- Summary and Motivation sections merged (SIG acceptance)
- Proposal section merged (design agreement)
- Implementation start date
- Graduation to general availability
- Deprecation or replacement (if applicable)

Include dates and relevant PR links where possible.
-->

## Drawbacks

<!--
Analyze potential drawbacks of implementing this OEP. Consider:

1. Implementation complexity
2. Operational overhead
3. Learning curve for users
4. Maintenance burden
5. Impact on existing workflows
-->

## Alternatives

<!--
Document alternative approaches considered and why they were not selected.
Include sufficient detail about each alternative to demonstrate:

1. Your thorough exploration of options
2. The trade-offs involved in the decision
3. Why the chosen approach is superior for this use case
