# Auth Task Group 1: Core Authentication Framework

## Overview
Establish the foundational authentication framework that all cloud providers will implement. This includes core interfaces, factory patterns, and common authentication utilities.

## Tasks

### Task 1.1: Design and Implement Core Authentication Interfaces ✅ COMPLETED

**Description**: Define the core interfaces that all authentication providers must implement. This includes the main Credentials interface and supporting types for token management, HTTP client configuration, and service endpoint resolution.

**Dependencies**: None

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ `pkg/auth/interfaces.go` with Credentials, TokenProvider, CredentialsProvider interfaces
- ✅ Provider and AuthType enums integrated in `interfaces.go`
- ✅ Config struct with fallback support in `interfaces.go`
- ❌ `pkg/auth/errors.go` with authentication-specific error types (not yet implemented)

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Credentials interface with Provider(), Type(), Token(), SignRequest(), Refresh(), IsExpired()
- ✅ TokenProvider interface with GetToken() and RefreshToken()
- ✅ CredentialsProvider interface for credential resolution
- ✅ ChainProvider for fallback authentication
- ✅ HTTPTransport for automatic request signing
- ✅ All provider types (OCI, AWS, GCP, Azure, GitHub) defined
- ✅ All auth types for each provider defined

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Credentials interface supports authentication operations
- ✅ TokenProvider interface supports token management
- ❌ Error types need to be implemented
- ✅ All interfaces have godoc documentation
- ✅ Unit tests validate interface contracts

### Task 1.2: Implement Authentication Factory Pattern ✅ COMPLETED

**Description**: Create a factory system that allows registration of provider-specific authentication implementations. The factory should support provider discovery, configuration validation, and credential instantiation.

**Time Estimate**: 2 days

**Dependencies**: Task 1.1

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ `pkg/auth/factory.go` with DefaultFactory implementation
- ✅ Provider registration integrated in DefaultFactory (no separate registry.go)
- ✅ Factory configuration and validation logic
- ✅ Global factory instance with Get/Set methods

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ DefaultFactory with thread-safe provider registration
- ✅ ProviderFactory interface for provider-specific factories
- ✅ RegisterProvider() method for dynamic registration
- ✅ Create() method with fallback support
- ✅ SupportedProviders() and SupportedAuthTypes() methods
- ✅ Global factory instance management

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ DefaultFactory can register and retrieve provider factories
- ✅ Factory validates configuration before creating credentials
- ✅ Supports concurrent access with sync.RWMutex
- ✅ Includes helper methods for provider discovery
- ✅ Unit tests with mocked providers

### Task 1.3: Create HTTP Transport with Request Signing ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

**Description**: Implement an HTTP transport layer that automatically signs requests based on the provider's authentication requirements. This transport should be composable and support middleware patterns.

**Time Estimate**: 3 days

**Dependencies**: Task 1.1

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ HTTPTransport implementation in `pkg/auth/interfaces.go`
- ✅ Request signing via Credentials.SignRequest() interface
- ❌ Middleware support for logging, metrics, retry (not yet implemented)

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ HTTPTransport struct with RoundTrip method
- ✅ Automatic request cloning to preserve original
- ✅ Delegation to Credentials.SignRequest() for signing
- ✅ Fallback to http.DefaultTransport
- ❌ Middleware/interceptor pattern not implemented

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Transport correctly signs HTTP requests
- ❌ Request/response interceptors not implemented
- ✅ Token refresh handled by Credentials implementation
- ✅ Preserves original request via cloning
- ✅ Minimal performance overhead
- ⚠️ Integration tests exist in provider packages

---

### Task 1.4: Implement Credential Chain Provider ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

**Description**: Create a chain provider that tries multiple authentication methods in sequence until one succeeds. This enables fallback authentication strategies and environment-aware credential resolution.

**Time Estimate**: 2 days

**Dependencies**: Task 1.1

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ ChainProvider implementation in `pkg/auth/interfaces.go`
- ✅ Basic chain ordering support
- ⚠️ Returns last error instead of aggregated errors

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ ChainProvider struct with GetCredentials method
- ✅ Tries all providers in sequence
- ✅ Stops on first successful authentication
- ❌ No dynamic provider addition/removal
- ❌ No caching of successful provider
- ⚠️ Simple error handling (returns last error only)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Chain provider tries all configured providers in order
- ✅ Stops on first successful authentication
- ❌ Error aggregation not implemented
- ❌ Dynamic provider management not supported
- ❌ No caching mechanism
- ⚠️ Basic functionality tested in provider packages

---

### Task 1.5: Implement Token Caching and Refresh

**Description**: Create a token management system that caches authentication tokens and refreshes them before expiry. This should be thread-safe and support different caching strategies.

**Time Estimate**: 2 days

**Dependencies**: Task 1.1

**Deliverables**:
- `pkg/auth/cache.go` with token caching implementation
- `pkg/auth/refresh.go` with automatic refresh logic
- Configurable cache strategies (memory, file, custom)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Tokens are cached and reused within validity period
- Automatic refresh triggered before expiry (configurable buffer)
- Thread-safe access to cached tokens
- Supports cache invalidation on demand
- Metrics for cache hit/miss rates
- Unit tests validate concurrent access patterns

---

### Task 1.6: Add Comprehensive Logging and Debugging

**Description**: Implement structured logging throughout the authentication system with appropriate log levels and context. Include debug mode for troubleshooting authentication issues.

**Time Estimate**: 1 day

**Dependencies**: Tasks 1.1-1.5

**Deliverables**:
- Structured logging integration in all components
- Debug mode flag for verbose output
- Log sanitization to prevent credential leakage

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- All authentication operations have appropriate log entries
- Sensitive information is never logged
- Debug mode provides detailed authentication flow
- Log levels are consistent and meaningful
- Performance impact of logging is negligible
- Security audit confirms no credential exposure

---

### Task 1.7: Create Authentication Configuration Management

**Description**: Build a configuration system that supports multiple configuration sources (environment variables, files, runtime) with validation and schema enforcement.

**Time Estimate**: 2 days

**Dependencies**: Task 1.1

**Deliverables**:
- `pkg/auth/config.go` with configuration types
- `pkg/auth/validator.go` with validation logic
- Configuration loaders for different sources

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Supports environment variables with provider-specific prefixes
- Reads configuration from files (JSON, YAML)
- Runtime configuration via API
- Validates all required fields based on auth type
- Provides helpful error messages for misconfigurations
- Unit tests cover all configuration scenarios

---

### Task 1.8: Implement Common Authentication Utilities ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Description**: Create utility functions and helpers that are used across multiple authentication providers, such as JWT handling, OAuth flows, and certificate management.

**Time Estimate**: 2 days

**Dependencies**: Task 1.1

**Deliverables**:
- ❌ `pkg/auth/jwt.go` with JWT token utilities
- ❌ `pkg/auth/oauth.go` with OAuth2 flow helpers
- ❌ `pkg/auth/certs.go` with certificate handling

**Implementation Notes**:
- Each provider currently implements its own authentication utilities
- Common patterns could be extracted in the future
- OAuth2 flows are handled by provider-specific implementations

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ❌ JWT utilities not implemented as common code
- ❌ OAuth2 helpers not extracted
- ❌ Certificate handling is provider-specific
- ❌ Common utilities not yet identified
