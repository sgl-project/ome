# Gopher Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the original `gopher.go` file to use the new multi-cloud storage and auth abstractions, replacing OCI-specific implementations with provider-agnostic interfaces.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Import Updates
- Replaced OCI-specific imports (`ociobjectstore`, `principals`) with generic storage and auth packages
- Added imports for the new multi-cloud storage and auth abstractions

### 2. Struct Modifications
- Added `storageFactory` field to the Gopher struct for multi-cloud storage support
- Added `StorageConfig` type to properly configure storage with embedded auth config

### 3. Constructor Updates
- Modified `NewGopher` to initialize the storage factory using `initializeStorageFactory()`
- Storage factory is now properly initialized with all cloud providers registered

### 4. Storage Client Creation
- Replaced `createOCIOSDataStore` with new `createStorageClient` method
- New method creates provider-agnostic storage clients based on URI parsing
- Supports authentication configuration extraction from model parameters

### 5. Download Implementation
- Updated `downloadModel` to use the new storage interface
- Replaced OCI-specific `BulkDownload` with provider-agnostic approach
- Now supports both bulk downloads (for providers that implement `BulkStorage`) and sequential downloads
- Updated object listing to use the generic `List` method with `ListOptions`

### 6. URI Parsing
- Updated `getTargetDirPath` to use the new `parseStorageURI` function
- Returns generic `storage.ObjectURI` instead of OCI-specific types
- Supports multiple cloud provider URI formats

### 7. Authentication Configuration
- Added `extractAuthConfig` method to extract auth configuration from model parameters
- Maps storage parameters to appropriate auth types for each provider
- Supports both default auth types and custom configurations

### 8. Verification Updates
- Renamed `verifyDownloadedFiles` to `verifyDownloadedFilesV2`
- Updated to work with generic storage interfaces
- Simplified verification to size checks (checksum verification can be provider-specific)

## Benefits

1. **Multi-Cloud Support**: Models can now be stored in OCI, AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing OCI configurations continue to work unchanged
3. **Unified Interface**: Same code paths work for all cloud providers
4. **Extensibility**: New providers can be added without changing the core Gopher logic
5. **Better Separation of Concerns**: Authentication and storage are properly decoupled

## Migration Notes

- The changes maintain backward compatibility with existing OCI storage URIs
- No changes required to existing model configurations
- New cloud providers can be used by simply changing the storage URI format
- Authentication is automatically configured based on the provider and parameters

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with existing OCI models to ensure backward compatibility
2. Test with new cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) 
3. Verify bulk download functionality for providers that support it
4. Test authentication with different auth types for each provider
5. Verify file integrity checks work correctly

## Next Steps

1. Update integration tests to cover all cloud providers
2. Add performance benchmarks comparing different providers
3. Document URI formats and authentication options for each provider
4. Consider adding retry logic specific to each cloud provider's characteristics
