//
// Without this gate, both Components of a 2-Component Sequential group
// would recreate concurrently the moment the operator bumps both images:
// the Sequential state machine correctly emits `decoder.Surging` then
// `engine.Surging`, but the dispatcher fires Update on whichever
// Instance's `detectUpdateTrigger` returns true, regardless of which
// Component the state machine considers active. The composite phase
// `decoder.Idle` / `Sequential.Awaiting` never lands in status because
// engine starts surging before decoder finishes.

// observeSequentialComponentsForGate builds the per-Component
// RolloutInFlight observations the gate needs from authoritative IR
// status. Mirrors buildComponentObservation's revision-hash compare

// consult. Returns one ComponentObservation per `components` entry —
// Components with no status block get a zero-valued observation
// (RolloutInFlight=false), which is exactly what the active-selector
// needs.
//
// RolloutInFlight is derived from THREE independent signals:
//
//  1. Revision-hash skew: `UpdateRevision != CurrentRevision` — the
//     classic "spec changed and status caught up enough to record the
//     new target name" signal. This is what fires once the deferred
//     AggregateAndWriteStatus has stamped UpdateRevision=target.Name on
//     the Component being reconciled.
//
//  2. Status lag: `ir.Status.ObservedGeneration != ir.Generation` —
//     fires at the *moment of bump*, after the projector has written
//     the IR spec but BEFORE the IR's deferred status write has run.
//     In that window UpdateRevision still names the OLD CR (so signal
//     #1 is silent) even though the Component is about to roll.
//     Same-object compare: ir.Status.ObservedGeneration mirrors the
//     IR's own metadata.generation, so it says nothing about the
//     parent ISVC — that is signal #3's job. Strict equality: any
//     divergence means the status block was not computed against the
//     spec being observed, so it cannot vouch for convergence.
//
//  3. Projection lag: the parent-generation annotation the projector
//     stamps on every pass differs from the live isvc.Generation (or
//     is absent). The ISVC controller projects the group's IRs one at
//     a time, so between the operator's bump and the completion of
//     that projection pass a peer IR can look fully converged while
//     its new spec simply hasn't been written yet. Failing closed
//     here keeps "at most one Component rolls" honest across that
//     window; the signal self-clears the moment the projector
//     re-stamps the annotation — including on Components whose
//     projected spec did not change at all (a partial bump), which is
//     what lets the gate release a later-in-Order Component without
//     waiting on an idle earlier one. Strict equality again: a stamp
//     from a different generation — either side — means the ISVC and
//     IR in hand are not one consistent snapshot.
//
// Over-detection from signals #2/#3 is harmless. A Component whose
// target PodSpec didn't actually change still gets observed as
// in-flight here, but detectUpdateTrigger in the dispatcher returns
// needs=false for that Component (its pods' RunningRevision already
// matches target.Name) and the gate is never consulted. Once the
// projector and the IR status writer catch up, the noise clears.
