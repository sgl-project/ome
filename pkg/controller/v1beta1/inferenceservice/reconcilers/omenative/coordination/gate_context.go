// GateContext caches the per-(ISVC, Component) prelude work shared by
// every Check*Gate: nil-ISVC and absent-coord-block short-circuits, the
// ResolveGroups + MembershipFor resolution, and the short-circuit
// reason string. Built once via ResolveGateContext and threaded into
// each gate.
//
// The dispatcher pays for the prelude exactly once per per-Instance
// tick instead of once per gate (4×: ratio + surge | unavailability +
// sequential). The existing Check*Gate public entry points are
// preserved as thin wrappers that build a fresh GateContext on every
// call — direct callers (and the large existing test surface) don't
// need to know about the helper.

	// ShortCircuit is true when the gate stack should bypass this

	// Hold is the fail-closed inverse of ShortCircuit: the Component belongs
	// to a declared rollout group but no run has pinned an effective plan
	// (the run is opening this pass, or the plan is parked unresolvable), so
	// updates must be DENIED. Without it, the window between a target
	// divergence and the pin — or a park — would roll the Component forward
	// on a plan nothing validated, silently skipping its declared gates.

	// gates fail closed (deny with a retryable reason). There is no
	// fallback to the ISVC's copied LifecycleStatus.

// CheckUnavailability / CheckSequential calls thread through. The
// dispatcher calls this once per per-Instance tick so the
// ResolveGroups + MembershipFor work doesn't run 4 times per dispatch.
