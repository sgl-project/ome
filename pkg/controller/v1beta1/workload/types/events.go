	// EventReasonFoundOrphan fires when Restart or recreate-Update
	// finds a pod under the OMENative selector but missing the

	// delete it; the operator must re-classify or remove the pod
	// manually.
	EventReasonFoundOrphan EventReason = "FoundOrphan"

	// edit cleanup deletes pods keyed to a superseded revision — debris

	EventReasonSupersededWreckageCleaned EventReason = "SupersededWreckageCleaned"

	// EventReasonAutoMigrationTriggered fires when the deadline
	// disposition records a relocation directive (terminal AutoRecover
	// ledger entry) for a stuck Instance — its rebuild will be steered
	// off the recorded node. Value matches the legacy omenative
	// detector's reason string.
	EventReasonAutoMigrationTriggered EventReason = "AutoMigrationTriggered"

	// EventReasonAutoMigrationCapReached fires exactly once per budget
	// fill — when the disposition records the relocation directive that
	// exhausts the (component, instance) AutoRecover budget
	// (lifecycle.autoMigrate.maxAttempts). Subsequent over-budget

	// EventReasonRetryBlockReleased fires when the operator release

	EventReasonRetryBlockReleased EventReason = "RetryBlockReleased"

	// changed.
	EventReasonRetryBlockReleaseSkipped EventReason = "RetryBlockReleaseSkipped"

	// Ready Instance with no live pods and no in-flight operation to
	// Pending. Status-only; recovery stays with the ordinary passes.
	EventReasonInstanceDemoted EventReason = "InstanceDemoted"

	// EventReasonPodForceDeleted fires when scale-down escalation
	// force-deletes (grace 0, UID-preconditioned) a Terminating pod
	// overdue past its own deletion deadline on a node that provably
	// cannot acknowledge the termination (gone, or unreachable-tainted /
	// NotReady beyond the configured threshold). Names the pod, node,
	// evidence branch, and overdue duration.

	// EventReasonPodDeleteBlockedByFinalizer fires (once per pod UID)
	// when a Terminating pod is overdue past its deletion deadline but
	// pinned by foreign finalizers. Report-only: OME never strips
	// another controller's finalizer, so the teardown stays blocked
	// until the finalizer owner resolves it.

	EventReasonUnsupportedSchemaVersion EventReason = "UnsupportedSchemaVersion"
	EventReasonMigrationCompleted       EventReason = "MigrationCompleted"
	// EventReasonMigrationExpired fires when a non-terminal Manual
	// migration record passes its Deadline: the record is closed
	// Failed, the pair's Migrate ops are cleared, the surge is torn
	// down by the ordinary scale-down batch pipeline, and the source
	// phase is restored from observation.

	// network / NVLink / TPU topology domains, which breaks the
	// tightly-coupled collectives a multi-node runtime needs (NCCL/RCCL/
	// NIXL all-reduce, multi-host TPU sessions). The operator sets
	// engine.topologyKey / decoder.topologyKey (e.g. a NVLink/RDMA domain
	// label, or the GKE TPU topology label) or declares a worker
	// podAffinity. Advisory only — never blocks the create. Dedup'd per
	// (owner, Component) per process.
