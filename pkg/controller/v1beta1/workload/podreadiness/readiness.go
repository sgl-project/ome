// Package podreadiness implements the multi-writer readiness gate
// protocol for OMENative's `ome.io/serving` pod condition.
//
// Pattern ported from RBG (`sigs.k8s.io/rbgs/pkg/inplace/pod/readiness`).
// The condition's Message field carries a JSON list of {UserAgent, Key}
// entries — one per writer that wants the pod NotReady right now.
// Status=True iff the list is empty AND containers are ready (the
// latter is kubelet's responsibility via the standard readiness gate
// machinery).
//
// Why multi-writer: OMENative has at least four overlapping reasons
// to want a pod NotReady — migration source drain, in-place update
// drain, restart drain, scale-down drain — that may be in flight on
// the same pod simultaneously. A single binary True/False gate has
// the writers race to overwrite each other; the multi-writer protocol
// lets them coexist as independent message-list entries.
//
// All writes use Status().Patch with strategic merge on the condition
// list (patch-merge-key=type), so kubelet's concurrent writes to
// PodScheduled / ContainersReady / PodReady are preserved. Every patch
// pins metadata.resourceVersion from the read it was computed against,
// so a stale base 409s instead of silently overwriting another
// writer's hold; retry.RetryOnConflict re-reads and re-applies. The
// in-loop re-read goes through the caller-supplied live reader (the
// AuthoritativeReader role): a watch-backed cache lagging the
// controller's own preceding status patch would re-serve the stale
// resourceVersion on every retry and the loop could never converge.
//
// # Gang readiness equivalence (multi-pod)
//
// Multi-pod Instances require gang-readiness: each pod should remain
// NotReady until every sibling in the Instance reaches ContainersReady.
// The multi-pod path carries no separately-keyed gang writer; the
// gang-readiness contract is enforced instead by the Instance-create
// flow, which calls MarkPodServing on the Instance's pods ONLY once
// every leader and every worker reports ContainersReady=True. Before
// that gate no pod in the gang has serving=True, so none receives
// traffic.
//
// That gate is observably equivalent to a per-pod gang writer:
//   - A new pod's WriterLifecycle/KeyLifecycleInstanceReady stays in
//     the message list until the controller writes the MarkPodServing
//     removal in the create flow's Ready promotion. (The condition
//     starts non-existent on a fresh pod, which is treated as "writer
//     is implicitly holding"; the first MarkPodServing creates it with
//     Status=True.)
//   - The gate covers the WHOLE Instance, so the flip happens
//     atomically across leader and workers. There is no partial
//     "leader serving, workers still warming" window.
//
// A per-pod gang hold — wanted, for instance, by a partial in-place
// update on a multi-pod gang — is a separately-keyed writer the
// multi-writer protocol already admits without re-architecting.
