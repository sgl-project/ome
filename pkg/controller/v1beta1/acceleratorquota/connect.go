// Connector keeps a cross-cluster transport in step with the WorkloadCluster
// registry. It is the management plane's half of multi-cluster quota: something
// has to hold a client for each member before anything can be projected onto
// one.
//
// It READS the registry and never writes it — no status, no conditions, no
// finalizer. That restraint is the whole design. WorkloadCluster status has
// exactly one writer, the registry's own reconciler in ome-manager, and that
// writer keeps its grace and backoff state in memory rather than behind a lease.
// A second process reporting its own probe results would flap the condition
// between them, churn LastTransitionTime, and lose the argument silently:
// conflicts on that path requeue without surfacing. Leader election is no help
// either, since the two binaries hold independent locks.
//
// So the registry decides what is reachable and this follows. Ready=True
// connects, anything else disconnects. Deferring to the owner also means the
// grace period is applied once, by the process that measured the failure —
// mirroring the condition inherits that damping for free, where a second prober
// would fight it.
