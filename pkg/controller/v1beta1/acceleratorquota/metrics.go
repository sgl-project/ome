// Collectors for the numbers the quota passes already compute. Every one is
// observed at the controller call site that produced it, so pkg/quota stays a
// library with no metrics dependency of its own.
//
// The capacity and backend families below carry no plane label. Capacity
// derivation and materialization both run in workload mode only -- r.Capacity
// and r.Materialize are populated on that branch alone -- so a mode label could
// only ever hold one value, and a constant label is a column that costs
// cardinality and answers nothing. The budget family further down does carry
// it, because both modes publish budgets and mean different things by them.
//
// The capacity gauges are a full snapshot of the last pass, so each is Reset
// before it is repopulated: a flavor being added has to drive the series it
// used to own back to zero, and a stale series that merely stops updating
// would read as a fleet that still has unattributed accelerators.

// Per-node accelerator accounting, written from the same pass that builds
// status.budgets so the series and the CR cannot disagree.
//
// The identifying label is quota, not node: this package already reports
// ome_quota_capacity_nodes, which counts machines, and one word meaning both a
// Kubernetes node and a quota-tree node three panels apart is a trap. quota is
// the AcceleratorQuota object name, which is cluster-scoped and
// webhook-validated, so it needs no namespace and cannot run unbounded.
//
// These do carry plane. Both modes publish budgets and the same series means a
// different thing in each: on a workload plane nominal is this cluster's share
// and admitted is what its Kueue queues hold, while on a management plane
// nominal is the authored fleet total and usage arrives only through the
// member-status funnel. A fleet-wide query that mixed them would be summing
// two different quantities.
//
// path carries the root-to-node position alongside quota, because a bare object
// name does not say where in the tree a budget sits and two tenants under
// different parents can be told apart only by their ancestry. It is derived from
// quota rather than independent of it, so it multiplies no cardinality -- a node
// has exactly one path -- but it does change when a node is reparented, which
// recordBudgets handles rather than leaving two live series for one node. Empty
// means the tree could not reach the node from the root, matching status.path.
//
// Lent is deliberately absent. The model has no lent figure -- an ancestor's
// borrowed is recomputed rather than summed from its children, because a loan
// between two siblings is internal to the subtree that contains them. Adding a
// Go-side lent would invent a number the tree does not have; it is derivable in
// PromQL over a subtree for anyone who wants it.
