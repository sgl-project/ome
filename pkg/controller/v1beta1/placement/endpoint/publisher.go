// Package endpoint programs ONE concrete global-traffic backend so the global
// host of a multi-cluster InferenceService resolves to whichever workload
// cluster currently wins the placement race.
//
// The control-plane fan-out controller (package placement) already records the
// winner and the winner's externally-addressable URL in
// status.placement.{cluster,endpoint}. That is status-only: an external LB has
// to consume it. This package closes that gap by actually programming a backend
// — the Gateway API HTTPRoute backend (GatewayAPIPublisher) is the first
// concrete implementation; the EndpointPublisher interface lets DNS/GSLB
// backends be added later without touching the reconciler.
