// Package obsmetrics holds cross-controller scale-operability Prometheus
// collectors shared by the ISVC reconciler, the IR reconciler, the
// OMENative coordination layer, and the workload op dispatcher. It is a
// leaf package (only depends on prometheus + controller-runtime metrics)
// so every controller can wire it without import cycles. Collectors are
// registered with the controller-runtime registry at package init so the
// operator's /metrics endpoint surfaces them with no extra wiring.
//
// Cardinality is deliberately controlled: metrics avoid pod-level labels.
// The pod startup histogram and active scale-down gauges carry the stable ISVC
// identity so operators can compare workloads and locate deferred work. This
// assumes tens to low hundreds of ISVCs per cluster; pod identities are
// excluded because fleets may contain thousands of pods and pod names churn
// across rollouts.
