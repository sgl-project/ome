/*
AcceleratorQuota is the fleet capacity-budget CRD. One CR is one node of a
single-rooted quota tree: a Cohort node groups other nodes, a ClusterQueue node
is a leaf that binds serving namespaces and carries an accelerator budget per
(resource, flavor) pair, which is how Kueue keys quota. spec.parentRef is the
edge to the parent; the tree is the graph of those edges, rooted at the single
reserved parent-less node.

The type lives in two planes and means something slightly different in each. On
a management plane the tree is admin-authored and spec.budgets[].nominal is the
FLEET-wide allowance; the controller computes each cluster's share and projects a
per-cluster copy of the tree onto every workload cluster. On a workload cluster
the tree is normally projected rather than authored: nominal is already resolved
to THAT cluster's share, and the local controller renders it into stock Kueue
objects. A single-cluster install authors the tree locally instead, and the same
controller both resolves and renders it.

Access model: on each plane the admin (or, for a projection, the projector
ServiceAccount) is the sole writer of spec, and that plane's quota controller is
the sole writer of status. A projected copy carries AcceleratorQuotaOriginLabel;
a validating webhook rejects hand-edits to it.
