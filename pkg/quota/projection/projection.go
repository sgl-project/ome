// Package projection renders the copy of a fleet quota tree that belongs on one
// workload cluster.
//
// A management plane authors one tree for the whole fleet, but a member can only
// enforce numbers of its own. So each member receives its own copy: same shape,
// same names, and in place of every fleet-wide allowance the share that member
// was apportioned. Rendering is separated from applying for the same reason the
// Kueue materializer is — the mapping is where the mistakes live, and a pure
// function can be tested exhaustively against a table.
//
// Three properties of a projection are load-bearing and none of them is obvious:
//
//   - It carries a RESOLVED number and never an unresolved split. The policy that
//     produced the share, and the per-cluster breakdown it came from, are dropped:
//     a member that could see them could re-derive a different answer, and two
//     planes computing the same split is how they drift.
//   - Its ancestors come too, but WITHOUT budgets. A leaf's parentRef has to
//     resolve on the member or the tree does not assemble there, so every tier
//     between the leaf and the root is projected — as pure topology, because a
//     fleet total is meaningless on one cluster and a budget-less node is
//     unconstrained for containment.
//   - The reserved root is NOT projected. The member's own controller creates it,
//     bare, and derives that cluster's capacity onto its status. Projecting one
//     would put two writers on a single object, which is the thing the whole
//     origin-marking scheme exists to prevent.
