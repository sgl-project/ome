// Package shares splits a fleet-wide allowance into per-cluster ones.
//
// A management plane authors one nominal for the whole fleet, but a workload
// cluster can only enforce a number of its own: Kueue's nominalQuota is
// per-cluster, so the fleet total has to be resolved into shares before it can
// be projected. This is that resolution, and nothing else — no I/O, no
// knowledge of clusters beyond the names and weights it is handed.
//
// The one contract that matters is that the shares sum to the total EXACTLY.
// A split that loses a chip to rounding silently shrinks the fleet's usable
// capacity; one that gains a chip lets the fleet admit more than an admin
// authorized, which is the failure the whole tree exists to prevent. Both are
// invisible in any single cluster's status, so neither would be noticed from
// the outside.
//
// Exactness rules out floating point and rules out truncating division. The
// method here is largest-remainder: give every cluster its floor, then hand the
// units that division could not place to whoever was closest to earning one.
// Arithmetic is on inf.Dec rather than int64 because a budget may name any
// resource — cpu carries milli precision, and memory in binary units overflows
// MilliValue long before it overflows a cluster.
