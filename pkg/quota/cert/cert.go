// Package cert self-manages the webhook serving certificate.
//
// The component generates its own CA and serving cert, stores them in a Secret,
// and injects the caBundle into its own ValidatingWebhookConfiguration — so the
// admission path works out of the box with no cert-manager in the cluster and no
// Issuer or Certificate in the chart. Rotation is handled on a timer thereafter.
// This mirrors what Kueue does by default, which matters because the quota plane
// is usually installed alongside Kueue and an operator should not need a second
// cert story for it.
//
// Delivery to the webhook server is via the kubelet, not this process: the
// Secret is mounted at CertDir, so a generated cert becomes servable only once
// the kubelet re-projects it. That projection is the slow step, and it is why
// certificate setup is a phase of its own — Bootstrap runs it on a throwaway
// manager before the real one exists, and Manage then keeps it fresh.
//
// The trade is a real one and worth naming: self-injection requires write access
// to the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration this component owns. Options scopes that
// as narrowly as the library allows — one named webhook config, no mutating
// webhooks — but list/watch on the kind cannot be narrowed, because the rotator
// builds an unfiltered informer over it.
