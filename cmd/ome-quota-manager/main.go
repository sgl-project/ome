// Command ome-quota-manager is the OME fleet-quota control plane (OEP-0024): it
// assembles the AcceleratorQuota tree, reports each node's position and
// condition, and — in a later increment — renders the tree into Kueue or
// projects per-cluster shares onto members.
//
// It is a separate binary from ome-manager on purpose. Rendering a tree needs
// cluster-wide write on Kueue's ClusterQueue and Cohort, and that grant should
// not ride the ServiceAccount that also runs the InferenceService reconcilers
// and the fail-closed pod mutating webhook. A separate Deployment keeps the
// blast radius of the quota plane to the quota plane, and lets an operator run,
// scale, and roll it independently of serving.
