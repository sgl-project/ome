This section of the documentation helps you learn about the components, APIs and
abstractions that OME uses to represent model serving, model training, models, and dedicated AI clusters.

## APIs

### [Base Model](/ome/docs/concepts/base_model)

The BaseModel CRD manages the lifecycle of foundational Hugging Face compatible and TensorRT LLM/AI models such as GPT,
BERT, and other architecturesï¼Œ model type, model format, capabilities, model sizes and model configurations.
These base models can be used for both training and serving.
This resource has both namespace-scoped and cluster-scoped which can be used to define base models for different models.

### [Fine-Tuned Weight](/ome/docs/concepts/fine_tuned_weight)

The FineTunedWeight CRD manages the weights of models fine-tuned from a base model, allowing for task-specific optimization.


### [Serving Runtime](/ome/docs/concepts/serving_runtime)

The ServingRuntime CRD manages the runtime environment for model serving, allowing for dynamic scaling and configuration of model-serving containers.
This resource has both namespace-scoped and cluster-scoped which can be used to define serving runtimes for different models.


### [Inference Service](/ome/docs/concepts/inference_service)

The InferenceService CRD manages the entire lifecycle of model-serving workloads, including model versioning, scaling, and traffic routing. 
It supports real-time inference for both single-node and multi-node deployments, ensuring seamless model updates and efficient scaling.

### [Ingress](/ome/docs/concepts/ingress)

OME supports a range of ingress controllers for external access to model serving workloads. 
This section provides an overview of the available ingress controller options, including their capabilities, configuration, and features.


### [Benchmarks](/ome/docs/concepts/benchmarks)

OME integrates with the latest GenAI-Bench benchmarks to provide real-time benchmarking capabilities for AI models. 
This section provides an overview of the GenAI-Bench benchmarks, how they work, and how to use them with OME.
